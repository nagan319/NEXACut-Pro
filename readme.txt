Outline:
Standalone application for Windows
CNC stock stored in SVG format
Use of OpenCV allows for easy addition of already used stock
Files for new parts converted from STL to SVG format
Part placement is optimized by a genetic nesting algorithm
*Possible integration with SolidWorks API for full automation
